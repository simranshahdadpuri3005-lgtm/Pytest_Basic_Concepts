**Pytest Execution Examples**

This repository demonstrates how to use Pytest, a popular testing framework for Python. It includes examples of writing test functions, using fixtures for setup and teardown, and exploring other Pytest features.

**Overview**

    Test Functions: 
    Learn how to write tests that validate the behavior of your code. Each test is independent and checks specific functionality.
    
    Fixtures: 
    Understand how to use fixtures to provide reusable setup and teardown for tests, making tests cleaner and more maintainable.
   
    Parametrization: 
    Explore running the same test with multiple sets of input data to cover more scenarios efficiently.
    
    Skipping and Expected Failures: 
    Learn how to mark tests to be skipped or expected to fail under certain conditions.
    
    Common Commands: 
    Get familiar with useful Pytest commands for running all tests, running specific tests, enabling verbose output, debugging, and generating test reports.

This repository is designed as a reference for beginners and intermediate users to see practical examples of Pytest usage and concepts in action.
